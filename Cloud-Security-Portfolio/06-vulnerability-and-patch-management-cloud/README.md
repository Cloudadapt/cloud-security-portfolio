# Vulnerability & Patch Management in the Cloud

**Date:** August 24, 2025

## Summary (first person)
I set up continuous vulnerability assessment and patching for compute and containers in the cloud with risk‑based SLAs and clear ownership.

## Business context
We needed to close the gap between detection and remediation for cloud workloads.

## Control objectives (mapped)
- **NIST CSF:** ID.RA, PR.IP, DE.CM
- **CIS Controls:** 7, 12, 16, 18
- **ISO 27001:** A.12, A.14

## What I did (high level)
- Enabled managed vulnerability scanning for instances and container images.
- Defined SLAs by severity and asset criticality; created exception documentation.
- Rolled out maintenance windows and automated patch application with pre/post checks.
- Implemented rollback criteria and smoke‑test runbooks.
- Reported weekly risk trends to app owners and leadership.

## Evidence to include
- Risk register view with remediation SLAs.
- Patch rollout calendar and change records (redacted).
- Before/after vulnerability counts by severity.
- Rollback plan template and test notes.

## Metrics I report
- % of critical/high vulns remediated within SLA.
- Patch compliance by environment (dev/stage/prod).
- Mean time to remediate by severity.
- # of rollbacks vs successful patches.

## Interview: STAR narrative
**Situation:** Inconsistent patching led to accumulating vulnerabilities.  
**Task:** Establish continuous scanning and predictable remediation.  
**Actions:** Implemented scanning, defined SLAs, automated patches with maintenance windows, created rollback/tests.  
**Result:** SLA adherence improved, critical exposure dropped, and changes became auditable.
