# Threat Detection & Incident Response Automation

**Date:** August 24, 2025

## Summary (first person)
I operationalized cloud threat detection and automated first‑response actions for common findings while keeping humans in the loop for approvals.

## Business context
We needed faster response to commodity threats and a clean evidence trail for audits.

## Control objectives (mapped)
- **NIST CSF:** DE.CM, DE.AE, RS.AN, RS.MI, RS.RP
- **CIS Controls:** 8, 13, 16, 17, 18
- **ISO 27001:** A.12, A.16

## What I did (high level)
- Enabled native threat detections and centralized findings.
- Implemented alert routing by severity and owner; reduced noise with tuning playbooks.
- Automated containment for specific events (e.g., quarantine an instance, disable a compromised credential) with approval steps.
- Wrote incident runbooks and evidence collection checklists.
- Conducted tabletop exercises and captured lessons learned.

## Evidence to include
- Alert routing matrix and ownership map.
- Tuning playbook showing rules suppressed vs justified.
- Sample incident timeline and post‑incident review (redacted).
- Automation flowchart and approval proof.

## Metrics I report
- Mean time to acknowledge/contain.
- % of alerts auto‑handled vs escalated.
- Reduction in false positives.
- Tabletop drill cadence and action closure rate.

## Interview: STAR narrative
**Situation:** Alert fatigue and slow initial responses.  
**Task:** Speed up detection and containment without creating blind spots.  
**Actions:** Centralized findings, tuned alerts, added automation with human approvals, created runbooks and drills.  
**Result:** Reduced time to contain, fewer false positives, clearer evidence for audits.
