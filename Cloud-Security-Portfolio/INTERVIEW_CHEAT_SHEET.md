# Interview Cheat Sheet (Cloud Security Projects)

Use these short first‑person lines during interviews.

## Secure Three‑Tier Baseline
- *“I built a secure three‑tier baseline with WAF, private subnets, centralized logging, and full encryption, then validated backups and documented guardrails for rapid, safe onboarding.”*
- Outcomes: 100% at‑rest encryption, no public DB access, faster team onboarding.

## IAM Least Privilege
- *“I rationalized cloud roles, enforced MFA and session limits, eliminated long‑lived keys, and institutionalized quarterly access reviews with evidence and SLAs.”*
- Outcomes: >50% fewer admin roles, audit findings closed.

## Data Protection & Secrets
- *“I standardized encryption, centralized secrets, mapped classification to controls, and set rotation/revocation procedures.”*
- Outcomes: Eliminated plaintext secrets in repos, near‑total encryption coverage.

## Threat Detection & IR Automation
- *“I centralized findings, tuned alert noise, and automated safe containment with approvals, backed by runbooks and tabletop drills.”*
- Outcomes: Lower MTTA/MTTC, fewer false positives, clean evidence trail.

## CI/CD & Supply Chain Security
- *“I secured the pipeline with reviews, scanning, and identity‑based deployments; I added policy checks and time‑boxed exceptions.”*
- Outcomes: Reduced exposed secrets, safer changes, clear SLAs.

## Vulnerability & Patch Management
- *“I implemented continuous scanning with risk‑based SLAs and automated patch windows with rollback criteria and smoke tests.”*
- Outcomes: SLA adherence improved, critical exposure reduced.
