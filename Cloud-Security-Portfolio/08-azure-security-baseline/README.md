# Azure Security Baseline (Breadth)

**Date:** August 24, 2025

## Summary (first person)
I built a compact Azure baseline to demonstrate multi‑cloud awareness: policy enforcement, secure identity practices, key/secrets management, and defender controls.

## What I did (high level)
- Enforced baseline policies across subscriptions/resource groups.
- Implemented privileged identity workflows and access reviews.
- Centralized secrets/keys in a managed vault with rotation guidance.
- Enabled cloud‑native defender recommendations and tuned noisy alerts.

## Evidence to include
- Policy assignments summary.
- Access review sample and PIM workflow notes.
- Vault key/secret inventory (redacted).
- Defender recommendations snapshot and exceptions.
