# Cloud Security Portfolio (Plain-Text, Audit-Ready)

**Prepared:** August 24, 2025

I created multiple end‑to‑end cloud security projects that I can speak to in interviews and showcase on GitHub. Each project is documented in plain language with: business context, mapped controls, what I did (no code), evidence to include, metrics, and STAR narratives. This is designed to help me land a cloud security role quickly by demonstrating real, audit‑ready work.

## Projects Included
1. Secure Three‑Tier App & Governance Baseline (AWS)
2. Identity & Access Management: Least Privilege & Access Reviews
3. Data Protection: Encryption, KMS & Secrets Management
4. Threat Detection & Incident Response Automation
5. CI/CD & Supply Chain Security (GitHub to Cloud)
6. Vulnerability & Patch Management in the Cloud
7. Network Security & Zero Trust Principles *(optional)*
8. Azure Security Baseline *(optional)*

## How to use
- Add sanitized screenshots, diagrams, checklists, and reports into each project's `/artifacts` folder.
- Keep credentials and secrets out of the repo; store them securely elsewhere.
- For each project, complete the evidence checklists and metrics sections with your actual results.
- When interviewing, use the short pitch and STAR narratives provided in each README.

## Suggested repo layout on GitHub
- One top‑level repo named `cloud-security-portfolio` (this folder).  
- Each project is a subfolder with its own README and artifacts/runbooks/policies subfolders.

## Disclaimer
All artifacts should be sanitized/redacted. Do not upload sensitive data.
